          Welcome to www.Ayy Kori.com. The Service is operated by Masterkey
          Technologies Limited (“We”, “Us”, “Ayy Kori” or “Our” where such
          expression shall unless repugnant to the context thereof, be deemed to
          include its respective legal heirs, representatives, administrators,
          permitted successors and assigns). Please read these terms and

        <p className="text-left ">
          Our membership is available through registration after you submit
          certain requested information to Ayy Kori. During registration, we
          display our current Terms and Conditions for your perusal. Ayy Kori
          reserves the right to update and change the Terms and Conditions
          provided hereunder as and when required, without any prior consent or
          permission of the Users. Please be informed that Ayy Kori members may
          run any sponsored advertisements referring to Ayy Kori on Google,
          Facebook, or any other site. In such cases prior permission must be
          obtained from Ayy Kori in writing, failing to do so may cause the
          member’s account to be terminated at the discretion of Ayy Kori.

        <h2 className="  text-xl  font-bold">3. Our Service </h2>
        <p className="text-left ">
          Our Service allows users who register on the Platform (“Member/s“) and
          therefore create an account with us (“Account“) to earn a profit on
          tracked purchases of products belonging to the Brand Partners, through
          customized links shared by Members of the Ayy Kori Platform. To
          qualify for profit, the Brand Partner must confirm that the Member’s
          purchase through the customized link is tracked, genuine and
          successful (constituting a “Qualifying Transaction”). Members can
          share these customized Ayy Kori links with their friends, family and
          so on. When any Qualifying Transactions are generated through these
          links and Ayy Kori receives a commission fee for these Qualifying
          Transactions from Brand Partners, Ayy Kori will pay Members “Profit”
          for sales generated via their customized Ayy Kori links. Please note
          that if for any reason whatsoever, Ayy Kori does not get paid
          commission from Brand Partners for Qualifying Transactions, then no
          Profit is due to the Member as well. In the event that the Brand
          Partners do not track a transaction using their affiliate tracking
          system, then such sales will not be paid to Ayy Kori, and hence any
          due or expected profit from these sales will also not be paid to the
          Member. Our help pages provide further information about these
          circumstances.

        <p className="text-left ">
          If You are a natural person, (i) as a condition to Your use of the
          Platform, You must be 18 (eighteen) years of age or older; and (ii) by
          visiting the Platform or accepting these Terms and Conditions, You
          represent and warrant to Ayy Kori that You are 18 (eighteen) years of
          age or older and that You have the right, authority and capacity to

          access and use the Platform for the purposes of procuring the
          Services, on behalf of such persons. You must register for the Service
          using accurate and current information about yourself – including your
          correct name, address and any other requested details. If you are
          asked for and provide, details of a bank account or Cheque payment
          details or other payment mode details into which you wish to receive
          payments (your “Profit Receipt Method“), you (a) must ensure that you
          are, and remain, fully entitled to use that profit Receipt Method, and
          (b) confirm that you wish to receive profit through that Profit
          Receipt Method. You should keep this information updated through your
          Account. Generation, collection and dissemination of ‘Sensitive
          Personal Data or Information’ is in accordance with Digital Security
          Act, 2018 as amended from time to time and allied rules require the
          User’s express consent. By affirming assent to this Policy by clicking
          on the “I agree with the Terms and Policy” button at the time of
          registration, the User provides consent to such information generation
          and the collection of the same as required under applicable laws. We
          may also be required to share this data with our Brand Partners for
          the purpose of their risk analysis and any other statutory
          requirements. By clicking on the “I agree with the Terms and Policy”
          button you allow us to share your data and information with the Brand
          Partners. Note that your Profit Receipt Method (such as BFTN, Cheque,
          MFS transfer, Gift Cards or other payment modes as We may introduce)
          may have rules about the maximum or minimum payment that you can
          receive through that Profit Receipt Method. Important: You must ensure
          that the email address and mobile number we hold for you are kept
          up-to-date and that you have full access to it – we will be sending
          you important messages there. If you change your email address or
          mobile number, then you must change the details we hold for you on
          your Account

        <h2 className="  text-xl  font-bold">5. Profit and Referral Fees </h2>
        <p className="text-left ">
          After a Member successfully completes a Qualifying Transaction, and
          once we have received the resulting Profit for that Qualifying
          Transaction, we pass that Profit to the Member through his/her Profit
          Receipt Method. Such payments shall be applied for and will be
          disbursed automatically after 45-80 of the application, to the member
          on the 1st day and the 16th day of every month, as long as it is a
          working day. If not, the amount will be disbursed on the first next
          working day. The Published shall have the option to withdraw the full
          or a partial sum of the earned Profits by clicking the Pop-Up withdraw
          button which will be made available on their portals on the dates
          specified above. The members shall have the right to choose their
          preferred payment mode (i.e Bank/Mobile Wallet) and Ayy Kori shall not
          be liable for non-transfer or wrongful transfer of payments in cases
          where the Member has failed to provide the correct payment information
          into the Ayy Kori Portal/Dashboard. Please note that there are various
          circumstances in which a transaction with a Brand Partner may not
          constitute a Qualifying Transaction or Profit may not result from it.
          The Member understands that all transactions made by him/her are not
          with us, but with the individual Brand Partner. Our help pages provide
          further information about these circumstances. Further, from
          time-to-time Brand Partners may increase or decrease the commission
          paid – in which case the profit offer illustrated on our Platform may
          be incorrect. By default, your applicable transactions will be
          credited in line with the commission reported to us by the Brand
          Partner, which may be more or less than the advertised rate. We shall
          not be liable for any difference in the expected profit by the Member
          and the actual Profit received by the Member. When we have traced a
          paying, Qualifying Transaction to your Account, we will credit your
          Account with a ‘pending payment’. Once the Brand Partner confirms the
          transaction, the payment will be marked as ‘validated’ – this can take
          30 to 80 days or more from the date of the purchase. If the goods are
          returned or the sale reversed or amended by any means then the Profit
          payment will not be made. Apart from the Brand Partner, it is also
          mandatory for the members to intimate Ayy Kori about any returns or
          exchanges for which they might have earned Profit unduly. Whether a
          transaction shall qualify as a Qualifying for-Profit Transaction
          (including a Qualifying Referral Fee) shall be at the sole discretion
          of the Brand Partner or us and the Member understands and agrees to
          the same. We shall not be held responsible if the Brand Partner fails
          to report a sale to us or does not qualify a transaction as Qualifying
          Transaction. Further, we shall not be responsible in the event due to
          some technical or other error we cannot trace a sale back to the
          Member and does not qualify the transaction as a Qualifying
          Transaction or a Qualifying Referral for any reason whatsoever. Whilst
          we will endeavour to recuperate non-payments from the Brand Partner,
          the decision of ourselves, the Brand Partner or Brand Partner’s
          tracking agent is final. Whilst we will try and recuperate missing
          commissions, at any point we reserve the right not to chase missing
          commission claims, particularly where no purchase has been made.
          Further, in the event that the Brand Partner feels that the purchase
          is not genuine for any reason whatsoever and we do not receive any
          Profit for the transaction, the Member will not receive any Profit.
          The Ayy Kori Service also provides a unique one-time referral fee to
          its Members for new members introduced by them in the manner provided
          on the Platform (“Qualifying Referral“), provided that the newly
          referred member remains a Member themselves for at least two
          successful payment cycles as specified above and additionally they
          will have to earn a qualifying amount of 1000tk via Qualifying
          Transactions. No referral fee shall be disbursed to the referring
          member until and unless the referred member has earned the qualifying
          amount as above. The company reserves the right to revise the
          qualifying amount at its own discretion without any notification to
          its members. We reserve the right to reclaim or make balance
          adjustments accordingly where it has been established that any credit
          has been applied in error. This will include but is not limited to
          transactions where the credit is not genuinely due or payment for any
          credited transaction has not been received from a Brand Partner or its
          agencies and/or misuse or fraud. This can include transactions which
          are already marked as payable or validated in your Account, or for
          transactions which have already been paid over to you by BFTN, MFS
          transfer, Cheque, Gift Cards or any other payment modes that we may
          introduce from time to time. In all such incidents, Ayy Kori has the
          right to recover all unduly paid profit that the member is not
          entitled to earn, through legal proceedings as per the laws of the
          land.

        <h2 className="  text-xl  font-bold">6. Your Account </h2>
        <p className="text-left ">
          You can withdraw your validated profit regardless of the amount earned
          on the above-mentioned payment cycle days. In the event, the Member
          decides to close the Account with us (on purpose/by mistake), and if
          at such time of closure is before a designated payment cycle day, the
          Profits in your account shall be forfeited and the member will not be
          able to get any further payment from Ayy Kori. Even in situations
          where a member’s previously published links are being used to place
          orders, no payments shall be remitted to the member and the member
          will have to reopen an account on our website to avail of our services
          and benefits.

          8.7.1. Your information is regarded as confidential and therefore
          shall not be divulged to any Third Parties, unless as provided
          hereunder and unless legally required to do so to the appropriate
          authorities, or if necessary, for providing the Services through the
          Platform.

        <p className="text-left ">
          8.7.2. Your Personal Information/Sensitive Personal Data is maintained
          by Us in an electronic form on our equipment, and on the equipment of

          8.7.3. People who can access your Personal Information: User
          Information will be processed by our employees, authorised staff,

          8.7.4. Security Practices. We treat data as an asset that must be
          protected against loss and unauthorised access. We employ many
          different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized
          access by members inside and outside Ayy Kori. We follow generally
          accepted industry standards to protect the User Information submitted
          to Us and information that We have accessed, including managerial,
          technical, operational and physical security control measures.
          However, for any data loss or theft due to unauthorized access to the
          User’s electronic devices through which the User avails the Services,

          your password to anyone else. You are responsible for keeping this
          password confidential and for any use of your account. If you use a
          shared or public computer, never choose to have your login ID/email
          address or password remembered and make sure to log out of your
          account every time you leave the computer. You should also make use of
          any privacy settings or controls We provide you on Our Platform.

          Service, or the entirety of it, where we have legal, security,
          technical or commercial reasons to do so. We will endeavour to give
          you 30 days’ advance notice before taking such action, except where it
          is necessary to take earlier action for security reasons or because of
          technical difficulties which would otherwise adversely affect our
          service. There may also be times when the Service becomes inaccessible
          as a result of technical difficulties experienced by us or on the

          these difficulties where they are within our control. Please note,
          however, that we cannot guarantee continuous access to the Service or
          any of the content that appears on it. Nevertheless, we will strive to
          ensure that any periods of planned unavailability, which you will be
          informed of when you access the Service at the relevant time, are kept
          to a minimum. For security or other reasons, we may require you to
          change your password or other information which facilitates access to
          the Service; however, we will never ask you for your password via
          email, telephone, or any other means other than through the Platform.
          You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your
          password and any additional identifying information.
